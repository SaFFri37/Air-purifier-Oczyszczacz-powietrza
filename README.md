# Air-purifier-Oczyszczacz-powietrza


Program code in C ++ for building an air purifier, the heart of which is ESP32.

Controlling the fan and reading data from sensors takes place via a web server and an encoder. The system automatically connects to the programmed Wi-Fi network, displaying the IP address on the OLED display and the serial port monitor in the Arduino IDE application.
